            <p>GraVityRagE is a website made by me to showcase my projects (only 1 for now lol) as well as to practise web development. This website is made using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), before being published using Github Pages (kinda obvious from the ".github.io" in the link). There are 2 flags hidden in this website for those who are intereted in CTF. These flags are not hard to find for an average person with sufficient experience in CTF.</p>
